This is a tool to help tune a simple J2EE project. The idea is to log the 
execution time of each function by logging the entrance timestamp and exit 
timestamp. This is done by injecting code into .class and .jsp files. Also 
minor modifications to configuration files such as .xml files are included.

Database schema:
Table: Request (Long requestid primary key auto-increment, String resource, String state)
Table: Log(Long id primary key auto-increment, Long requestid references Request, String method, String operation)

This is a NetBeans project developed on windows platform. To run please 
build through NetBeans and copy "compilelib", "copyclasses", "copylib" and "workflow_2_8.dtd" 
into dist dirctory where the exported jar is located.
